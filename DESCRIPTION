Description: Provides tools for evaluating, comparing, and visualizing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) 
    used in causal discovery. The package includes metrics for assessing DAG structures, 
    visualizations of DAGs and their subgraphs, and methods for comparing DAGs using various 
    similarity measures such as Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) and Hamming Distance (HD).
