\title{Visualize and Compare Bayesian Networks, Highlighting Matching Arcs}
\usage{
vis_dag_comparison(
  bn1,
  bn2,
  option = 1,
  nodes = "all",
  name1 = "DAG 1",
  name2 = "DAG 2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bn1}{A Bayesian network (bn object) representing the first network.}

\item{bn2}{A Bayesian network (bn object) representing the second network.}

\item{nodes}{A character vector specifying the names of the nodes to visualize along with their Markov blankets.
If \code{"all"}, the entire network structures are visualized. Default is \code{"all"}.}
}
\value{
A side-by-side visualization of the two Bayesian networks, with matching arcs highlighted.
}
\description{
This function visualizes two Bayesian networks side by side, either as full networks or restricted to
specified nodes and their Markov blankets. Matching arcs between the two networks are highlighted
for easy comparison.
}
\details{
The function creates subgraphs of the Bayesian networks based on the provided nodes. If \code{"all"} is specified,
the entire network structures are visualized. Matching arcs between the two networks are styled differently
for emphasis.

Visualization details:
\itemize{
\item Matching arcs are highlighted with a specific color.
\item Nodes are styled uniformly across both networks.
\item Non-matching arcs are styled with a default color for each network.
}

The function uses \code{bnlearn::graphviz.plot()} for visualization, along with the \code{Rgraphviz} package for customization.
}
\examples{
library(bnlearn)

# Create two random Bayesian networks
bn1 <- random.graph(nodes = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
bn2 <- random.graph(nodes = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))

# Visualize the full networks side by side
vis_dag_comparison(bn1, bn2, nodes = "all")

# Visualize specific nodes and their Markov blankets
vis_dag_comparison(bn1, bn2, nodes = c("A", "B"))
