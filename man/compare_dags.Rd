\title{Compare DAGs and Compute Descriptive and Comparison Metrics}
\usage{
compare_dags(bn1, bn2, descriptive_metrics = "all", comparison_metrics = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{bn1}{A Bayesian network (bn object) representing the first DAG.}

\item{bn2}{A Bayesian network (bn object) representing the second DAG.}

\item{descriptive_metrics}{A vector of descriptive metrics to calculate (e.g., "n_edges", "n_colliders").
Default is "all", which computes all available descriptive metrics.}

\item{comparison_metrics}{A vector of comparison metrics to calculate (e.g., "shd", "tp", "fp", "fn").
Default is "all", which computes all available comparison metrics.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the selected descriptive and comparison metrics for each node's Markov blanket
and for the entire network (labeled as "All").
}
\description{
This function compares two Bayesian networks (DAGs represented as \code{bn} objects) and computes both
descriptive metrics for each network and comparison metrics between the networks. Metrics include
Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), Hamming Distance (HD), true positives (TP), false positives (FP),
false negatives (FN), precision, recall, and F1 score. The user can choose specific metrics to include.
}
\details{
The function works in two main steps:
\itemize{
\item Descriptive Metrics: Computes specified metrics for the entire network and for each node's Markov blanket.
Metrics include number of edges, colliders, root/leaf/isolated nodes, directed/undirected arcs, and degree-related metrics.
\item Comparison Metrics: Compares the structure of two Bayesian networks, calculating SHD, HD, TP, FP, FN, precision, recall, and F1 score.
These are calculated globally and for each node's Markov blanket.
}

The user can filter the results to include only specific metrics by setting \code{descriptive_metrics} and \code{comparison_metrics}.

\examples{
library(bnlearn)

# Generate two random Bayesian networks
bn1 <- random.graph(nodes = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
bn2 <- random.graph(nodes = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))

# Compare the DAGs using all metrics
result <- compare_dags(bn1, bn2)
print(result)

# Compare the DAGs with specific metrics
result_filtered <- compare_dags(
  bn1, bn2,
  descriptive_metrics = c("n_edges", "n_colliders"),
  comparison_metrics = c("shd", "tp", "fp")
)
print(result_filtered)
